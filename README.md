# Visualizing Scala 3 TASTy Interchange Format

`amaranth` converts Scala's `.tasty` tree format into a `.dot` graph format. This project is very work-in-progress and 
features are implemented on a need-to-use basis.

Major features not yet implement:

+ Clearer separation to distinguish types of nodes
+ Support of graphing remaining trees (terms + type trees)
